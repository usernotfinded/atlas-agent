## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Updated research workflow demo to include artifact health checking (`atlas research check-artifacts`).
- Added tests for check-artifacts demo integration, unsafe output detection, failure behavior, and pending-order guard.
- Schema versioning (`schema_version`) for all research workflow artifacts.
- Compatibility behavior for legacy artifacts without `schema_version`.
- Fail-closed handling for unsupported future schema versions.
- Read-only research artifact health check command: `atlas research check-artifacts`.
- Health checks for malformed JSON, unsupported/legacy schema versions, duplicate IDs, symbol mismatches, missing required fields, unsafe paths, and unexpected artifact locations.
- Docs-truth tests for schema versioning and health check boundaries.

### Changed
- New artifacts now include `"schema_version": "1"`.
- `load_research_artifact` fails closed on unsupported schema versions.
- `list` and `summary` skip artifacts with unsupported schema versions safely.
- `docs/research-workflow.md` and `docs/architecture.md` now document schema versioning and the `check-artifacts` command.

### Changed
- New artifacts now include `"schema_version": "1"`.
- `load_research_artifact` fails closed on unsupported schema versions.
- `list` and `summary` skip artifacts with unsupported schema versions safely.
- `docs/research-workflow.md` and `docs/architecture.md` now document schema versioning.

### Safety / Compatibility

- Research workflow remains paper-only and analysis-only.
- Research commands do not create approvals or pending orders.

- No kill-switch, risk, config, broker, submit, or live-trading gate weakening.

### Validation
- Version consistency passed.
- Forbidden-claim scan passed.
- Full pytest passed in latest validation.
- `pip check` passed.

- `./scripts/demo_research_workflow.sh` passed.
